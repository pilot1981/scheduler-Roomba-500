You need to modify the variables at the top: 
- set currentDay, 
- currentHour, 
- currentMinute according to the present time.
The pre-programmed schedule is to clean at 03:00 on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday and Friday. You can change this if you wish, by altering the daystorun and times variables.

Times are sent in 24 hour format. Hour (0-23) Minute (0-59)

***If you don't modify the schedule, the Roomba should start automatically after 2 minutes.

Put it all together

You should now have a partially undressed Roomba, and a programmed Arduino. Now it is time to connect them. With both unpowered, connect the following:

Arduino/ESP01 GND to Roomba ground (pin 6 or other pin of ESP)
Arduino/ESP01 TX (pin 1 on e.g. Uno or other pin of ESP) to Roomba RX (pin 3)

This is a picture with ESP01:

Now, the moment of truth. Press the "CLEAN" button on the Roomba, the light should go on. Plug in the USB for the Arduino. The Roomba light should turn off briefly, and after a few seconds the Arduino should blink it's LED. The schedule is now programmed, all done!

## Troubleshooting

Between each configuration/connection I suggest to do a factory default reset to be sure the roomba isn't in a strange/wrong state (ex. safe mode): you can do it please press and Hold the Dock and Spot button down for 10 seconds then release. I notice a strange state where to wake up and start to clean I have to press clean button for 3 or 4 times; after reset procedure all work fine and Roomba seem to wake up fine! This problem can prevent to start scheduled cleaning!

Example:
To schedule the robot to clean at 3:00 PM on Wednesdays and 10:36 AM on Fridays, send: [167] [40] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0] [15] [0] [0] [0] [10] [36] [0] [0]
To disable scheduled cleaning, send: [167] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0] [0]
