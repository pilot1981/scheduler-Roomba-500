You need to modify the variables at the top: set currentDay, currentHour, currentMinute according to the present time.
The pre-programmed schedule is to clean at 03:00 on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday and Friday. You can change this if you wish, by altering the daystorun and times variables.

Times are sent in 24 hour format. Hour (0-23) Minute (0-59)

***If you don't modify the schedule, the Roomba should start automatically after 2 minutes.

Put it all together

You should now have a partially undressed Roomba, and a programmed Arduino. Now it is time to connect them. With both unpowered, connect the following:

Arduino GND to Roomba ground (pin 6 or other pin of ESP)
Arduino TX (pin 1 on e.g. Uno or other pin of ESP) to Roomba RX (pin 3)


Now, the moment of truth. Press the "CLEAN" button on the Roomba, the light should go on. Plug in the USB for the Arduino. The Roomba light should turn off briefly, and after a few seconds the Arduino should blink it's LED. The schedule is now programmed, all done!
